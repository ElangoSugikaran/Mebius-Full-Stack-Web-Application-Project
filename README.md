## ⭐ Project Note

This project was built as part of my **MERN Stack course**, where I applied everything I learned—from frontend and backend development to API building, authentication, and deployment. The frontend is deployed on **Netlify**, and the backend runs on **Render**, fully connected through RESTful APIs.

Mebius represents my final course project and is showcased in my portfolio to demonstrate my full-stack development skills.
